It's easy to use also in libraries without dependency injection (see samples below).

*Please note that this is **unofficial** OpenAPI library* (It's not mantained by OpenAI Company).

## Note

This library has complete support asp.net dependency injection but you can use in any dotnet project type without dependency injection.
